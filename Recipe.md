First take a small bowl and add 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of white pepper, 1 tsp of onion powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of cayenne(optional), 1 tsp of oregano. Mix them all.

Now take the chicken Breast(each) and make a slice of it from the edge so that it is in the shape of a leaf, and the apply the powder made in the small bowl on both the sides of the breast.

Take a frying pan and add butter to it. Stir it till the buttery smell comes(DO NOT make the pan very hot or the butter will burn and it will not taste nice). Now, add the spice mixed chicken breasts and fry them until they turn kind of red(The colour of chicken is red only because of the cayenne, if you have not added them then the colour will be white). Fry both the sides and take them out. Now in the same pan add 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic. Stir it well. Add double milk and some salt to it. Stir it well until the cream gets a bit thick. 
Now add 2 tbsp of finely chopped Parsley and 1 tsp of oregano. Cut the fried chicken in pieces and add them to the cream. Stir well until it gets mixed nicely with the cream. Now add cooked pasta and pasta water(optional) to it.

Stir it well and it is ready to serve! Hope you like it!
